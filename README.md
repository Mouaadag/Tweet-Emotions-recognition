# Tweet Emotion Recognition: Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow

## Notes

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that our model depends on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Behaviour

In this project, we are going to create a recurrent neural network or `RNN` and train it on a tweet emotion dataset to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions. This is a multiclass classification problem in the natural language processing domain. We will be using `TensorFlow` as our machine learning framework.

## Steps

The notebook of model project is divided on parts that are :

1. Setup and Imports
2. Importing discover and clean Data
3. Split data to train, test and validation
4. Tokenizer
5. Padding and Truncating Sequences
6. Creating and Training Model
7. Model Evaluation
8. Use the model to predict emotions
